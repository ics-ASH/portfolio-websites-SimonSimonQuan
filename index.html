          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Week 1</p>
          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">In the first week we learned about the course, like what we would do and what websites we would be using like w3schools and codehs and github and vscode. We also made accounts for all the websites, and learned about google classroom, which is like hapara workspace but made by google. We also started making websites on vscode and github, it took a while to setup and all organize. We had to download a lot of things and click on many links but we eventually go it.</p>

          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Week 2</p>
          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">We worked on a website, lots of technical difficulties. also my website really looks ugly. I started adding other pages like comics, games, news in french, and useful links. They have nothing on them yet, except for the news in french on which I added my news in french that I used as my speech in french class last semester. Also I added a picture of coffee because that was the subject of the speech. Im trying to go for a blue colour theme.</p>
          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Week 3</p>
          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">I think we worked on websites and maybe started cmu? In cmu I started making a cat for my unit 1 project. It is going to take a lot of time because i had to put a grid over my reference image and correspond each point to the coordinates in cmu. It was hard work and the only thing that kept me sane was organizing each an every polygon into dozens of different groups. Also, it was really easy to confuse other colours with each other as they were all similar, but I did it.</p>
          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Week 4</p>
          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">I finished my cat in cmu and put it in my website. Also started making pong in cmu. I already have experience with scratch so I have an Idea of what Im doing, however cmu is more limited in the things you can do so I have to think outside the box. For example, I need to have global variables that I can change withing a function, and to do that I need to set it to some value of a hidden object, like the X position of a circle, because I'm able to change that within a function and also use it as a global variable.</p>
          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Week 5</p>
          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">In cmu i started work on a platformer. It is really laggy. I also know what I'm doing for this, the physics take a bit of time to figure out, especially to stop the player going through walls, but I managed to get it to run smoothly. Making levels were easy, it was just inserting different polygons. I made some script so that shapes were added to a group and based on what group they were in it would have different properties like ground our bouncy our death. This made it really easy to mae levels and it was super customizable.</p>
          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Week 6</p>
          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Finished platformer, $5 to anyone who can beat it. so far, I think 5 people have? It is incredibly hard, but somehow I managed to do it with only 27 deaths which is definetely a miracle. The amount of frame-perfect jumps is incredible. Also there is an easter egg at the end just for Mr. Jamieson. By the way, it normally takes people thousands of deaths to beat the game for the first time. It is definetly not worth the 5 dollars of time.</p>
          <br>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Week 7</p>
          <br>
