    <a style="color:rgb(32, 123, 214);" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/should-you-turn-off-your-computer-at-night/">Article</a>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">The idea of whether you should leave your computer on or not at night has always been heavily debated. On one hand, turning your computer on and off constantly would wear out its components. But on the other hand, leaving your computer on all the time would also wear it out. The article, titled “Should You Turn Off Your Computer At Night” tackles and dissects this problem</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">According to Steven Leslie, Geek Squad agent, if you use your computer multiple times throughout the day, you should leave your computer on. This avoids having to boot up your computer many times which would wear out the components. If you use your computer once a day, it is better to turn it off when it is not in use. This is because you do not need to regulary turn it on and is extremely  important with old computers that still have moving parts. For example, an old hard drive still uses moving parts that get worn out over time.</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Depending on needs, one could choose to leave their computer on or off. Some reasons to leave a computer on would be if they were using the computer as a server, or if the computer needs to run things in the background while they’re away. Leaving the computer on is also an option for lazy people who don’t want to wait for the computer to start up.</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Reasons to turn off the computer would be to save power or to silence notifications or the computer fan. Also, computers sometimes need a reboot to update or just perform better overall.</p>

    <a style="color:rgb(32, 123, 214);" href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-budget-version-of-the-7900-xt-gpu-is-coming-to-the-us-for-549-140050596.html">Article</a>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Amd is now selling their Radeon RX 7900 GRE (Golden Rabbit Edition) in the US which is basically a less expensive and powerful version of their 7900 XT for $549. It competes with NVIDIA's RTX 4070, for better performance and a lower price.</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Some of the specs that are included are Navi 31 XL GPU with 80 compute units, 160 AI accelerators and 16GB of GDDR6 memory. Compared to the 7900XT that has 20GB of GDDR6, 96 compute units and 168 AI accelerators in the 7900 XT. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE uses less power than the 7900XT making it easier to use with a wider user base.</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);"> AMD claims that it has a 12% more fps per dollar ratio than the RTX 4070 and can even compete against the RTX 4070 Super under specific situations. The GPU is not exactly new as it has been sold in computers in Europe but it is new for the US. It could be a great option for 1440p users and is compatible with many different types of builds.</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);"> The 160 AI accelerators and 16GB of DDR6 Memory is what is a new critical part which helps produce stable and clean images instantly. It will go on sale on February 27, 2024 for $549 in the US. If someone is interested in it they should act quickly as it is likely that they will be sold out and bought quickly.     </p>
