            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">The idea of whether you should leave your computer on or not at night has always been heavily debated. On one hand, turning your computer on and off constantly would wear out its components. But on the other hand, leaving your computer on all the time would also wear it out. The article, titled “Should You Turn Off Your Computer At Night” tackles and dissects this problem</p>
      <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">According to Steven Leslie, Geek Squad agent, if you use your computer multiple times throughout the day, you should leave your computer on. This avoids having to boot up your computer many times which would wear out the components. If you use your computer once a day, it is better to turn it off when it is not in use. This is because you do not need to regulary turn it on and is extremely  important with old computers that still have moving parts. For example, an old hard drive still uses moving parts that get worn out over time.</p>
      <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Depending on needs, one could choose to leave their computer on or off. Some reasons to leave a computer on would be if they were using the computer as a server, or if the computer needs to run things in the background while they’re away. Leaving the computer on is also an option for lazy people who don’t want to wait for the computer to start up.</p>
            <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Reasons to turn off the computer would be to save power or to silence notifications or the computer fan. Also, computers sometimes need a reboot to update or just perform better overall.</p>

        <a style="color:rgb(32, 123, 214);" href="https://www.engadget.com/amds-budget-version-of-the-7900-xt-gpu-is-coming-to-the-us-for-549-140050596.html">Article</a>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Amd is now selling their Radeon RX 7900 GRE (Golden Rabbit Edition) in the US which is basically a less expensive and powerful version of their 7900 XT for $549. It competes with NVIDIA's RTX 4070, for better performance and a lower price.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Some of the specs that are included are Navi 31 XL GPU with 80 compute units, 160 AI accelerators and 16GB of GDDR6 memory. Compared to the 7900XT that has 20GB of GDDR6, 96 compute units and 168 AI accelerators in the 7900 XT. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE uses less power than the 7900XT making it easier to use with a wider user base.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);"> AMD claims that it has a 12% more fps per dollar ratio than the RTX 4070 and can even compete against the RTX 4070 Super under specific situations. The GPU is not exactly new as it has been sold in computers in Europe but it is new for the US. It could be a great option for 1440p users and is compatible with many different types of builds.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);"> The 160 AI accelerators and 16GB of DDR6 Memory is what is a new critical part which helps produce stable and clean images instantly. It will go on sale on February 27, 2024 for $549 in the US. If someone is interested in it they should act quickly as it is likely that they will be sold out and bought quickly.     </p>

        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">When shopping online, especially during the holidays, it is easy to let one’s guard down. Online criminals are very aware of this and try to exploit this weakness as much as they can. Former cybersecurite commissioner to President Obama, Eric Cole, gives some advice on how to stay safe online.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Cybersecurity is not doing complex things but about doing simple but effective things instead, making it important to use common sense. A common tactic during this time is for hackers to buy advertisements on google that seem too good to be true. This is why it is important to use common sense and realize that it is often too good to be true. When someone is tempted and clicks on these advertisements they risk losing important information such as credit card numbers and identity. </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Hackers don’t usually target individuals, so they are more active during the holiday season where it’s easier to get a specific amount of credit cards. Because of the amount of people online, it is much more likely to be targeted during the holidays. Also, during the holidays, people make so many transactions that sometimes they don’t check their credit card statements as closely as they normally would. Contrary to popular belief, an adversary won’t be making huge purchases. In reality, they do small purchases here and there that easily fly under the radar.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">One way to keep safe is to have real-time alerting. That way whenever your credit card is used, you get an alert that you will have to authorize. It takes a few seconds, but is much easier than if your credit card actually becomes stolen.</p>

        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Blockchains are a technology that revolutionize the world as we know it, impacting everything from politics to healthcare. A blockchain is a database that is validated by a community, not an authority. Instead of relying on one thing, such as a government, blockchain is a collection of records maintained by many people all over the world. </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">A ‘block’ is a number of transactional records. The ‘chain’ is what links them together with a hash function, and as more and more records are made, the network of computers confirms it and pairs it with the previous entry, making it exactly what it sounds like: a block chain.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Since the entire blockchain is on a large network, no one person can control or change its history. This is important because it ensures that everything has happened previously in the chain, meaning no one can go back and change it. This creates a safe and untamperable database which is much more safe and secure than traditional ones. This allows blackchains to be used for other purposes than Bitcoin for their strong security. For instance, in the future blockchains could be used to store other important information such as medical records. </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Blockchains were first proposed way back in the 1970s, where a paper called “New Directions in Cryptography” proposed a ‘mutual distributed ledger’, the basic idea of a blockchain. However, it still be many years until advancements in technology allowed for the actual idea to take place in real life.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">In Bitcoin, every 10 minutes another block is created. Bitcoin miners use computing hardware to prove and verify transactions. Because of the 10-minute waiting period, transactions can stack up and create backlogs. One solution is to have less validations of transactions so that confirmations can happen faster.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Although there are many benefits to blockchain technology there are some issues that need to be addressed. Completing all the calculations and transactions requires a high amount of processing power. The footprint created by this is estimated to be equivalent to a small country. Transaction speed is another critical issue if we want to implement it in daily life. </p>

        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Researchers from the University of Waterloo in Canada are working on Assistive suits4 for people with impairments. These suits act as augmentation devices, but are also 100% manual. Then, researchers had the idea to give these robotics artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">The biggest challenge in creating these robotic exoskeletons for real-life implications is the control. Current ones use manual controls like a joystick or other interfaces that guarantee safe control. They are working on making autonomous control systems for these robotic exoskeletons using cameras and AI to control their movements. Using a large sample of walking images and videos that have been gathered by people wearing a mounted camera while walking around. This allows the AI to assess the environment it is in and make decisions based on this information. Creating more powerful learning algorithms can be expensive, so it is important to make an efficient and powerful algorithm. Like in self-driving cars, it is important to allow the user to make decisions in emergencies. This will require trust because the user still has to trust the exoskeleton to do its job. </p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">The project is still being worked on as of now. The researchers are currently optimizing their AI powered environment classification system to improve its accuracy and performance. However, it shouldn’t be long until their project becomes commercially available. They enhance the capabilities of the wearer and can be used in a wide variety of settings. They aim to reduce the amount of monotonous, mundane tasks that humans must perform leaving them free to think and dream.</p>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">The real question is, can it do homework?</p>
