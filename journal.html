    <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">The idea of whether you should leave your computer on or not at night has always been heavily debated. On one hand, turning your computer on and off constantly would wear out its components. But on the other hand, leaving your computer on all the time would also wear it out. The article, titled “Should You Turn Off Your Computer At Night” tackles and dissects this problem</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">According to Steven Leslie, Geek Squad agent, if you use your computer multiple times throughout the day, you should leave your computer on. This avoids having to boot up your computer many times which would wear out the components. If you use your computer once a day, it is better to turn it off when it is not in use. This is because you do not need to regulary turn it on and is extremely  important with old computers that still have moving parts. For example, an old hard drive still uses moving parts that get worn out over time.</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Depending on needs, one could choose to leave their computer on or off. Some reasons to leave a computer on would be if they were using the computer as a server, or if the computer needs to run things in the background while they’re away. Leaving the computer on is also an option for lazy people who don’t want to wait for the computer to start up.</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 77, 219);">Reasons to turn off the computer would be to save power or to silence notifications or the computer fan. Also, computers sometimes need a reboot to update or just perform better overall.</p>
